Linear Search:
    - Values need not be sorted
    - Time complexity: O(n)
    - Suitable when data set is small

Binary Search:
    - Values have to be sorted
    - Time complexity: O(log n)
    - Suitable when data set is large


Notes: 
    - Logs are basically the opposite of exponents
    - Reading values from a list is a constant time operation - O(1)
    - Logarithmic executions/runtimes are also called sublinear runtimes.
    - Quadratic: O(n^2)
    - Cubic: O(n^3)
    - Quasilinear: O(n log n)2
    - Cubic > Quadratic > Quasilinear > Linear > Logarithmic
    - Polynomial runtime are more effecient than exponential runtime.
    - Brute force algorithms use exponential runtime
